      <h2>About Me </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      I am Jose Manuel Hernandez.
      I like a few things, which include but are not limited to business, humanitarian help, and computer science.
      For one, the entire process fascinates me in business, from starting with a problem to ending with clients. I could do this all day.
      Second, in humanitarian help, I have been to many countries and seen so many people in need. That whenever it is possible, I put in my grain of salt.
      Help can come in many ways, shapes, and forms.
      Third, in computer science, it all started with my best friend; he brought me into this. A few years later, I decided to take college courses and finish my degree.

    I heard it once said: once google becomes your best friend, you can do anything.
    I took it to heart. Hence, my favorite website: <a href="https://www.google.com/">google</a>
