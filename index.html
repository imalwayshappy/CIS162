  <p>
    I am Jose Manuel Hernandez.
    I like a few things, which include but are not limited to business, humanitarian help, and computer science.
    For one, the entire process fascinates me in business, from starting with a problem to ending with clients. I could do this all day.
    Second, in humanitarian help, I have been to many countries and seen so many people in need. That whenever it is possible, I put in my grain of salt.
    Help can come in many ways, shapes, and forms.
    Third, in computer science, it all started with my best friend; he brought me into this. A few years later, I decided to take college courses and finish my degree.
